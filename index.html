		<p class="lead">Using CDC data, we've created a model using
		machine learning that predicts diabetes in a patient with
		93% accuracy. Our hope is, given a patient's
		statistics, our model can be used to shed greater light on 
		their risk level for type II diabetes.</p>

              <p class="lead">The Montana Rural Health Data Science Center is
	      a nonprofit organization created by computer science students at <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu">MSU</a>. We are experts in techniques at the
	      forefront of data science, and
	      are motivated to use our backgrounds to benefit healthcare
	      in the communities we grew up in. Our approach is two-fold. We are
	      aimed both at preventing serious medical conditions by warning
	      patients before their onset, and at diagnosing such conditions 
	      rapidly
	      if they are present in patients. To do this, we've created
	      predictive models for various conditions, which are dependent on
	      the health statistics of patients. We're also developing models 
	      to assist radiologists in diagnosing conditions
	      from medical scans. All of our services are (and
	      always will be) completely free. </p>
